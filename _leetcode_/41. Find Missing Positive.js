        Why >= 0 is Correct
        When we check if(nums[i] >= 0), we're looking for positions that are still unvisited:

        nums[i] > 0: Positive numbers (never marked as visited)
        nums[i] = 0: Zeros that were never marked (meaning the number i+1 was never seen)
        Both cases indicate that number i+1 is missing from the original array.

        Example to Illustrate
        Consider array [1, 0, 3]
        marking: [-1, 0, -3]
        >=0 means 2 is missing.. (index 1), return i+1

// Place each number in its "correct" position: 
// number 1 should be at index 0, number 2 at index 1, etc.

Example walkthrough: [3, 4, -1, 1]

Initial: [3, 4, -1, 1]
i=0: nums[0]=3, should be at index 2. Swap with nums[2]=-1
     [−1, 4, 3, 1]
i=0: nums[0]=-1, invalid (negative), move to i=1
i=1: nums[1]=4, should be at index 3. Swap with nums[3]=1
     [−1, 1, 3, 4]
i=1: nums[1]=1, should be at index 0. Swap with nums[0]=-1
     [1, −1, 3, 4]
i=1: nums[1]=-1, invalid, move to i=2
i=2: nums[2]=3, already at correct position (index 2), move to i=3
i=3: nums[3]=4, already at correct position (index 3), done

Final: [1, −1, 3, 4]
Check: nums[1] ≠ 2, so answer is 2

// We must alternate between different projects
// Working on the two biggest projects is optimal (greedy approach)
// Now, How Much to Drain? Check for 3rd largest.
// What is "drain"? It's how many weeks we work on EACH of the top 2 projects
//  Total weeks added = drain * 2 (drain from a, drain from b)
// if (pq.size() > 0) {
    // const c = pq.root(); // Peek at 3rd largest
    // let drain = Math.max(b - c, 1);
    // idea from test case [100, 100, 100]:
    /*
            Heap: [100, 100, 100]
            Pop: a=100, b=100
            Drain ALL of b: drain=100
            count = 200, a=0
            Heap: [100]
            Final: 200 + 1 = 201 WRONG ANS
            
            // but if we peek at 3rd one..
            Heap: [100, 100, 100]
            Pop: a=100, b=100, peek c=100
            drain = max(100-100, 1) = 1
            count = 2, a=99, b=99
            Heap: [100, 99, 99]  so all three stay balanced

            Next iteration:
            Pop: a=100, b=99, peek c=99
            drain = max(99-99, 1) = 1
            count = 4, a=99, b=98
            Heap: [99, 99, 98]

            ... continues until everything is drained â†’ 300! CORRECT
            By only draining until b reaches c, we keep all projects balanced, allowing us to continue alternating efficiently

            Math.max(b - c, 1) why??
            b - c: Drain enough so that b becomes equal to c
            The max(..., 1) ensures we always make progress even when b == c
            Without the 1, we'd be stuck in an infinite loop when all top 3 are equal!

/* When Self-Loops Are Useful
1. State Machines & Finite Automata
Node stays in same state with certain input
Game states where player can "wait" or "do nothing"

2. Network Flow Problems
Self-loops can represent internal capacity or storage
Resource allocation within the same entity
// 2. Network Flow with Self-Capacity
Problems where nodes have internal storage/processing capacity

3. Dynamic Programming on Graphs
Representing "staying at current position" as an option
Time-based graph problems where waiting is allowed

4. Social Networks & Recommendation Systems
Users can like their own posts, follow themselves
Self-referential relationships

1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance
// Self-loops with weight 0 (staying in same city costs nothing)
// Floyd-Warshall naturally handles this

2. 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
// Waiting at airport (self-loop) might be optimal in some variants

3. 1162. As Far from Land as Possible
// Multi-source BFS where staying put is an option


AtCoder Problems:
1. ABC 237 D - LR insertion
Self-referential operations where elements can reference themselves
2. ABC 204 D - Cooking
DP where "doing nothing" (self-loop in state) is an option


1. Shortest Path with "Wait" Option
// You can wait at any vertex for cost 0
void addWaitEdges() {
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        graph[i][i] = 0; // self-loop with cost 0
    }
}

3. Cache/Memory Problems
// Data can stay in same cache level
// Self-loop represents cache hit (cost 0)

Design a subway system where passengers can wait at stations. Find minimum time to travel from A to B."
// Each station has self-loop (waiting costs time but might be optimal)
// if next train is delayed
for(int station = 0; station < n; station++) {
    addAdjMatrixEdge(station, station, WAIT_TIME, graph);
